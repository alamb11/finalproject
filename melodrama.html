<p>There have been thousands of pop albums about coming of age and young heartbreaks, but none of them come close to Lorde’s Melodrama. Written during Lorde’s transition to adulthood at 19 and 20, Melodrama shows the good, the bad, and the ugly of a young woman discovering herself in today’s world. There is never anyone that really gets it, but somehow Lorde just knows all the words and feelings that even you yourself can’t figure out. Growing up with this album is truly an experience like no other, I can’t think of a more perfect definition for the overcomplicated life, or melodrama, of a teenage girl.<br>
<br>Throughout Melodrama, Lorde uses the typical teenage life – breakups, parties, bad decisions – as only part of her story, but the big picture is her struggle to find her own self-acceptance, much like many lost teens. The hardest hitter of the album, Liability, dives deep into Lorde’s own insecurities causing this struggle. Roisin O’Connor from Independent describes the lyrics as “wryly self-aware with the tone of a person who’s too tired to fight anymore”. Like many teenage girls, she blames herself for her complications with relationships. But she’s giving up on trying to please others, Lorde has learned that she only needs herself to dance with.<br>
<br>The closing track of the album, Perfect Places, is a “perfect” answer to this 11-track journey for Lorde. She is doing what teenagers do, forgetting their regrets and leaving their problems for tomorrow with an intense party that won’t be remembered in the morning. But the question she raises is: Is that really the answer to all our problems? In a Pitchfork review of the song, Jenn Pelly says, “The promise of the house party is so rarely fulfilled: At any age, you are unlikely to find utopia in a drink and a stranger.” According to Lorde, no matter what you do or what you use to forget and find these perfect places, they don’t exist. The pain and hardships of life won’t disappear with material substitutions, you just have to face them.<br>
<br>Lorde’s exit from girlhood into the scary and unpredictable arms of life in Melodrama is a journey that is relatable to every young woman, whether they know it yet or not. Even though it’s an album about the teenage experience, it isn’t immature or trivial at all. It’s a raw and real piece of art that resonates with the harsh experiences that every teenage girl holds, and there isn’t a better depiction of the messy but beautiful time of growing up. It’s comforting to know someone who has all the answers to those larger-than-life teenage problems that the rest of the world doesn’t seem to understand, and that’s exactly what Lorde does for a generation like ours.</p>
