    <div class="about-text"><p>Hi! My name is Alana Lamb and welcome to Leading Women in Music, my blog where I review and talk about women in the music industry and their creations. Music is one of my main interests and passions, especially music created by female musicians, which is what inspired me to start this blog.</p> 
    <p>Some of my favorite female musicians at the moment are Taylor Swift, Boygenius, and Mitski. I really enjoy listening to their music and supportingthem as artists, which is part of what inspired me to start this blog!</p>
    <p>While I am still fairly new to blogging and website creation, this is a topic that I am thoroughly invested in and passionate about, and I am excited to learn more about these things while writing and creating things I love!</p>
