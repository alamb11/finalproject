<p>The critically acclaimed and now GRAMMY nominated debut album from indie supergroup 'boygenius' is nothing less than extraordinary. The combination of Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker, and Lucy Dacus, three of the most brilliant singer-songwriters in music today, creates an explosion of musical talent that is few and far between.<br>
<br>What makes "the record" so special is the deep bond between the three musicians that shines throughout everything they do together. Not only can you see it throughout the different tracks on the album, but also the way that they make music. Their love and dedication for each other amplifies their songwriting, their voices, and their individual talent overall. The women of the trio are all individually amazing, but the love that they bring out of each other creates something uniquely theirs. And that's what "the record" is all about.<br>   
<br>My personal favorites from "the record" are "True Blue", written by Lucy Dacus, a track dedicated to deep and loyal love, and "We're in Love", a ballad about the complexities and vulnerability of being in love. What I admire about both of the songs is the fact that they are so different yet so similar. It feels like the trio is exploring every corner of my brain with these two songs, the way they are able to replicate feelings that are so personal yet relatable is something that has really drawn me to "the record".<br>
<br>While this may seem a bit biased, being able to experience the songs from "the record" live in concert is also something that has created a deeper connection to the album for me. "boygenius" are truly amazing performers, the way they are able to convey their deep bond to the audience somehow makes the music even better. </p>
